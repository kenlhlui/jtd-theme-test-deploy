# Using as a remote theme
You can use this repository as a remote theme, powered by the [jekyll-remote-theme plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme). 

To do so, add the following two lines to your site's `_config.yml` file:
```yaml
remote_theme: "MDLutoronto/jtd-theme"

plugins:
    - ... (if you have other plugins)
    - jekyll-remote-theme
```
Also, you need to install the `jekyll-remote-theme` (version 0.4.3) gem by adding this line to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem "jekyll-remote-theme", "~> 0.4.3"
```
